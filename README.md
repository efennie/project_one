When life gives you Avocados, make Guacamole

Team Members: Arianne Toepfer, Bitty Fennie, Erica Smith

Project Mission:
    Use avocado purchasing data to infer popularity and profitability by size and location.  Determine the relationship between wealth and avocado popularity.

Research Questions:
    1. Which cities love avocados the most?
    2. Do states with higher income per capita buy more avocados?
	3. Which type of avocado is the biggest source of revenue for suppliers?  
    4. Is there a time of year that sees a spike in revenue?
	5. How has the average avocado price changed over time?  What is the predicted avocado price for 2021 based on our data?  
    6. Do different types of avocados have different price trends?
