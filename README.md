Project Mission:
    Use avocado purchasing data to infer popularity and profitability by size and location. Determine the relationship between wealth and avocado popularity.

Research Questions:<br/>
    1. Which cities love avocados the most?<br/>
    2. Do states with higher income per capita buy more avocados? 2017-2019<br/>
	3. Which type of avocado is the biggest source of revenue for suppliers? <br/> 
    4. Is there a time of year that sees a spike in revenue?<br/>
	5. How has the average avocado price changed over time?  What is the predicted avocado price for 2021 based on our data?<br/>  
    6. Do different types of avocados have different price trends? <br/>
